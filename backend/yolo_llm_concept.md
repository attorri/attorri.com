# YOLO + LLM Integration Concept

## Overview
This concept demonstrates how to:
1. Capture YOLO detections from a video feed
2. Buffer a certain amount of detection data
3. Format the data for LLM consumption
4. Send to an LLM (e.g., DeepSeek or AWS Bedrock) for analysis
5. Get insights about the scene

## Pseudo Architecture

```python
# Main components needed:
- Detection Buffer (stores last N seconds of detections)
- Scene Analyzer (converts detections to natural language)
- LLM Interface (handles API calls)
- Event Handler (triggers analysis based on conditions)
```

## Key Concepts

### 1. Detection Buffer
- Store rolling window of detections (e.g., last 30 seconds)
- Each detection includes:
  * Object class
  * Confidence score
  * Bounding box coordinates
  * Timestamp
  * Frame context

### 2. Scene Analysis
- Convert raw detections to natural language description
- Example format:
  ```text
  "In the last 30 seconds:
   - Person detected at (x,y) moving towards camera
   - Car detected at (x,y) moving left to right
   - Dog detected at (x,y) stationary"
  ```

### 3. LLM Integration
- Prompt structure:
  ```text
  System: "You are analyzing real-time object detection data. 
          Provide insights about the scene and potential events."
  
  Context: [Scene description from buffer]
  
  Query: "What significant events or patterns do you observe? 
          Are there any safety concerns or notable interactions?"
  ```

### 4. Trigger Conditions
When to send data to LLM:
- Time-based (every N seconds)
- Event-based (when specific objects detected)
- Pattern-based (when certain combinations occur)
- Threshold-based (when detection confidence peaks)

## Example Use Cases

1. **Security Monitoring**
   - Buffer unusual activity
   - LLM analyzes patterns and potential threats
   - Generates natural language security reports

2. **Retail Analytics**
   - Track customer movement patterns
   - LLM analyzes shopping behaviors
   - Provides insights on store layout optimization

3. **Traffic Analysis**
   - Monitor vehicle and pedestrian flow
   - LLM identifies congestion patterns
   - Suggests traffic management improvements

## Implementation Considerations

### Performance
- Buffer management to prevent memory issues
- Batch processing of detections
- Async LLM calls to prevent blocking

### Cost Optimization
- Smart triggering to minimize API calls
- Compression of detection data
- Caching of similar analyses

### Privacy
- Anonymization of sensitive data
- Local preprocessing before LLM submission
- Data retention policies

## Example Data Flow

```text
1. YOLO Detection
   [Person, 0.98] at (320, 240) -> Buffer

2. Scene Description
   "Person walking towards entrance, carrying bag"

3. LLM Prompt
   "Analyze the following scene:
    Last 30s: Person approaching entrance with bag.
    Previous context: No activity for 5 minutes.
    Query: Assess the situation and potential intent."

4. LLM Response
   "The person appears to be a customer entering the store.
    Normal approach pattern, no unusual behavior detected.
    Recommend standard greeting protocol."
```

## Future Enhancements
- Multi-camera correlation
- Historical pattern learning
- Custom LLM fine-tuning for specific contexts
- Real-time response automation
